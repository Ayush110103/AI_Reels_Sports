## ü§ñ AI Integration

### Script Generation

The application uses either OpenAI's GPT-4 or Google's Gemini to generate engaging scripts about sports celebrities. The prompts are carefully crafted to produce content that is:

- Factually accurate
- Engaging and concise
- Structured for short-form video

### Image Generation

DALL-E 3 is used to generate custom images for each sports celebrity based on carefully crafted prompts that highlight:

- Action shots during games
- Celebration moments
- Close-up portraits
- Trophy and achievement images
- Historic moments from their career

### Text-to-Speech

Amazon Polly converts the generated scripts into natural-sounding speech using the Neural engine for the most human-like voice quality. If Polly is unavailable, the system falls back to OpenAI's TTS service.

### Video Assembly

The final videos are assembled using FFmpeg by combining:

- The generated audio narration
- DALL-E generated images of the sports celebrity
- Smooth transitions between images
- Proper timing to match the narration

## üåê Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel for optimal Next.js performance.
